# flashcard-flask

This is my flashcard flask website, a final project for Intro to Python. The difficulties I encountered through the process of making this website were when I initially had troubles building the base flask website. I was able to use tutorials online to help get through that and set up my website correctly. From there, I began to expand off the tutorials to truly make this website my own. I decided to add an About page to give background on who I am. Another struggle I encountered was adding a scroll wheel function to my homepage, but with the use of the internet and some friends, I was able to figure it out. I also added a Study page using html and javascript that allows users to run through their cards and study them. Learning how to use HTML and Javascript was also a journey for me on this project. I was able to learn a lot more about how both langauges worked. My inspriation for this project was Quizlet as it is something that I have always used throughtout my studies. 

all code is in master branch

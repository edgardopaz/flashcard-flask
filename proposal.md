# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?

Flashcard Web App

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")

A website that allows you to study using flashcards. 

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

The website is meant to be used as a tool for study. It will ask the user for the questions and the answers to those questions. It will then store that data in a database. After the user has decided they have done all the questions they need, it will then randomly go through and select questions for the user to study, until the user no longer wants to study. 

## If planning to combine 1051's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to 1051, and which aspect(s) would relate to the other course?

none
## If planning to collaborate with 1 or 2 classmates for the final project, list their names, email addresses, and the names of their assigned TAs below.

TODO, if applicable

## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?

A good outcome I believe would be having at least one flashcard that works like it should. 

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

A better outcome would that all the cards are able to be selected at random and work well. 

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?

 The CSS is very user-friendly and the website has no bugs and runs great. 

## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?

I will need to acquire new skills using SQL and Flask as I'm not too familiar with either of them. It will also be my second time working with CSS, the only other time being during OwlHacks. I think this will be a great learning experience for me, as I wanted to do something that felt challenging and had a positive impact.
